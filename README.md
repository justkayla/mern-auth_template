# MERN-Auth Template

## Description

This is a template for authenticating login and registration for a MERN stack application. This template uses authentication middleware in the client and server environments.

## Installation

To install this app, download the code from this repo and open a terminal from the root of the downloaded folder. From there, enter `npm i` in the terminal to install all the required node modules (you must have node installed on your machine to do this). There is not a prepopulated seed file for this template. You are able to register and user and then log in with that same email/password. Once the modules are installed, enter `npm run develop` in the terminal to start the app. Your default web browser should automatically open with
the template running from the local host server.

## Usage

The first page that appears when you start the program should be the homepage. You can register and log in using the Login/Register modal in the top righthand corner of the navigation bar. Once you are logged in, you will see a Dashboard tab. There is no additional content provided with this template, other than the register/login/authentication functionality. This template is designed to be used as a starting point for an application that requires registration/login.
